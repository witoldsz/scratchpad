# Examples

Took a look around in this folder; `examples/benchmarks/` contains some larger examples.

Run examples as follows:

1. Navigate to the examples directory

    ```bash
    cd examples
    ```

2. Run "Hello, World!" example

    ```bash
    cargo run hello-world/helloWorld.roc
    ```

Some examples like `examples/benchmarks/NQueens.roc` require input after running.
For NQueens, input 10 in the terminal and press enter.
