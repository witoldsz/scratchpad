# Interactive examples

These are examples of how to make extremely basic
CLI (command-line interface) and TUI (terminal user interface) apps in Roc.

There's not currently much documentation for the CLI platform (which also doesn't support many operations at this point!)
but you can look at [the modules it includes](cli-platform) - for example,
multiple other modules use the [`Task`](cli-platform/Task.roc) module, including the
[`Stdin`](cli-platform/Stdin.roc) and [`Stdout`](cli-platform/Stdout.roc) modules.
